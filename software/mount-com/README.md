# mount-com — MOUNT.COM image-library utility (CP/M)

In-machine companion to the interposer web UI: mount `.IMD`/`.HFE`
images from the Pico-hosted library to drive A, B, or "Drive C" without
touching a browser.

Tracks: #27; protocol shared with `firmware/floppy-emulator/` mailbox
port; ships on the updated boot disk (#28).

## Definition

- CP/M 2.2 utility, assembly or compact C, tiny TPA footprint.
- Talks to the Pico through the mailbox port (address TBD from
  `docs/o1-memory-io-map.md` free decode windows).
- Commands (UX TBD): list library, mount image → drive, unmount,
  status. One-shot command-line style, consistent with `FATCOPY`.
- Graceful behavior on a machine with no interposer present (probe
  mailbox, clean error).

## Deliverables

- `MOUNT.COM` + source
- Usage doc (ships on boot disk)
- Mailbox protocol conformance tests (host-side, `tools/`)
