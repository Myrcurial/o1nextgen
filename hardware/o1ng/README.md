# o1ng — O1 Next Generation (modern-parts Osborne 1 reproduction)

A new PCB built from currently-available components that runs the actual
Osborne 1 ROMs and (nearly) all original software — with a Cherry MX
mechanical keyboard, the interposer's floppy/modem/printer/storage
personalities onboard, and composite video out (HDMI optional).

Tracks: #49 (feasibility + build), #52 (case + power research),
#53 (concept render: `docs/design/o1ng-lunchbox-concept.*`).

**Verdict from #49: feasible, medium complexity.** The O1 is almost
entirely memory-mapped commodity MSI/LSI — no custom silicon. CPUs are a
non-issue: CMOS **Z84C00 is in current production** (the replica
deliberately uses modern CMOS silicon where the interposer interfaces
AHCT to the original NMOS part).

## Machine decomposition (by difficulty)

| Block | Approach | Difficulty |
|---|---|---|
| CPU + RAM + ROM | Z84C00 (new), 64 KB SRAM (replaces 16× 4116 DRAM + refresh), 27C128/Flash BIOS | Trivial |
| Video | Char-gen + CRTC-class logic; composite out, HDMI option (interposer video personality reusable) | Moderate |
| Floppy | 360K half-height drive + onboard DD data separator (enables PC 360K MFM reads → FATCOPY, #51) | Moderate |
| I/O (serial/GPIB/RTC) | 6850 ACIA, IEEE-488, RTC — interposer personalities onboard | Moderate |
| Keyboard | Cherry MX matrix; O1-compatible scan encoding | Low–moderate |

## Shared power architecture (#52)

- **USB-C PD trigger board** as primary input: 15 VDC (or 19–20 V) PD →
  clean on-board +5V and +12V rails. Replaces the entire original PSU —
  and gets the RIFA caps out of the mix.
- **Battery option:** a ~15–19 V input rail suits an 18650 pack (4S).

## Form factors (share the power design)

1. **1:1 mainboard replacement** — drops into an otherwise-stock O1/O1A
   chassis. **As true to the original as possible**: a faithful
   reproduction of the stock machine, including a **40-pin DIP socketed
   Z80** (Z84C00) — deliberately socketed so the **interposer
   (`../interposer/`) is the upgrade path**: anyone wanting the advanced
   features (bus analyzer, virtual peripherals, WiFi modem, Gotek
   switching) installs the interposer onto this board exactly as they
   would on a 1982 original. **L-shaped board**: skinny arm services
   left-hand-side ports (front-left screw boss); chunky short side
   mounts front/rear right bosses. Stock port locations (front ports,
   power, internal video, floppy connectors) and only **four mounting
   screws** constrain layout.
2. **"Lunchbox" (O1 Next Generation)** — Dolch / Compaq Portable III
   idiom in **O1A blue/grey** industrial design; "keyboard seals the
   unit" aesthetic retained. Unlike the 1:1 board, this is a **fully
   integrated single board** — the interposer's capability set (video,
   storage, modem, keyboard input) is thoroughly grafted in rather than
   stacked on, following the original design language. One reason:
   integration keeps the timing margins needed for the **clock-doubled
   8 MHz "business turbo"** (#55) — limited usefulness, but everyone
   will be fine with it. ~8 cm thick: mainboard + 8" 4:3 LCD
   (composite/HDMI in) + 18650 pack, detachable flip-up keyboard.
   Optional rear "backpack" for a physical 5.25" half-height drive.

## Open questions

- Final video pipeline choice (discrete TTL vs small FPGA helper).
- LCD panel + input board sourcing for the lunchbox.
- Chassis fabrication route (sheet metal vs printed) for the lunchbox.
- Which interposer personalities are *onboard* vs *optional modules*.
