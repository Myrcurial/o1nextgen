# front-panel-ui — faceplate & UI pod

COMM-PAC-style faceplate covering one floppy storage pocket, providing
local physical UI for the interposer without opening the case.

Tracks: #14.

## Contents

- SD card / USB stick socket (disk-image library media)
- **Second USB-A port: keyboard input via the interposer** — a USB HID
  keyboard plugged in here is injected into the O1's keyboard matrix by
  the interposer (reusing the `../usb-keyboard-adapter/` RP2040 matrix
  firmware, #45/#47). The **original keyboard stays plugged in and fully
  functional**; the USB keyboard is an optional second input that just
  works, both live simultaneously.
- VGA or HDMI video out (SCREEN-PAC personality, #24)
- Small OLED status display
- Rotary encoder or 5-way d-pad (FlashFloppy-style menu UI)
- Hayes/USR-style LED bank: CTS/RTS/TX/RX/RING etc. (modem personality)
- Ribbon cable back to the interposer (`../interposer/`)

## Constraints

- Must route through the existing front-panel ventilation / IEEE-488
  openings — no case cutting on the host machine.
- All electronics on the interposer side of the ribbon where possible;
  the pod is mostly connectors + display + LEDs to keep the cable
  simple and the front end 5 V/3.3 V logic only.

## Open questions

- OLED controller choice (I²C vs SPI over the ribbon).
- Exact pocket geometry vs. COMM-PAC faceplate dimensions (measure
  against host machine photos, `research/pictures/`).
- Whether video out is HDMI (RP2350 HSTX/DVI) or VGA (resistor DAC) —
  decided with the #24 firmware personality.
