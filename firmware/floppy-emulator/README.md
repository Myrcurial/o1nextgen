# floppy-emulator — floppy interposer + image library (RP2350)

Gotek/FlashFloppy analogue built into the interposer: interrupt the
Shugart bus between motherboard and drives; mount `.IMD`/`.HFE` images
to either drive bay, or to "Drive C" as a persistent RAM disk. The
hardest firmware component — Greaseweazle/FlashFloppy-class timing.

Tracks: #20; format support per G2 research (#30, `docs/g2-formats.md`
when written); physical integration with `hardware/floppy-adapter/`.

## Definition

- MFM flux read/write emulation on PIO, pinned to core1; WiFi gated
  during flux windows (radio-jitter note, `firmware/README.md`).
- Image library in flash/SD, managed over WiFi (web UI) or from CP/M
  via `MOUNT.COM` (`software/mount-com/`).
- Must track the G2 multi-format set correctly (geometry, density,
  sector size/count, skew, interleave, DPBs).
- Coexistence rules with the physical Gotek/drive adapter
  (`hardware/floppy-adapter/`) — which device owns the bus in each
  configuration must be documented and enforced.

## Deliverables

- PIO flux engine + Shugart bus drive logic
- `.IMD` / `.HFE` image handling
- Mailbox port protocol spec for `MOUNT.COM`
- Web-UI mount/library endpoints
