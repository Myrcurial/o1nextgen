# screenpac-video — SCREEN-PAC 80/104-column video + HDMI (RP2350)

Emulates the SCREEN-PAC 80/104-column video personality and provides
modern video out (HDMI via RP2350 HSTX/DVI, or VGA resistor DAC via
`hardware/front-panel-ui/`).

Tracks: #24; char-gen ROM context in #44.

## Definition

- Tap the 24-pin char-gen socket (UA15) like the real ScreenPac; **read
  whatever font ROM is actually installed at init** — the personality
  works with early/late stock and Nuevo fonts without bundled ROMs.
- Emulate the SCREEN-PAC register interface so period software (and the
  ScreenPac service-manual behaviors, `research/screenpac/`) work.
- Render framebuffer → DVI/VGA; keep timing on PIO/core1 per the
  radio-jitter rule.
- Also the video source for the KVM console (`../kvm-console/`).

## The ScreenPac's physical interface (from the field service manual)

Per `research/screenpac/2F00040_service_2ndEd_1983.pdf` §6.12 (OCR:
`2F00040_service_2ndEd_1983.ocr.txt`), the ScreenPac install is:

1. Pull the Z80 and the char-gen ROM; the ScreenPac board plugs into
   **both** sockets (40-pin + 24-pin pin spacers), plus a power harness.
2. **A 14-wire IC harness soldered to logic-board IC pins** (Table 1,
   "solder connections") plus a **coax from logic-board B13 pin 6 to
   ScreenPac U1 pin 15**:

| Logic board IC.pin | Harness wire | | Logic board IC.pin | Harness wire |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| B11.12 | Blue 9 | | D17.14 | Green 10 |
| B16.1 | Grey 1 | | D18.14 | Orange 2 |
| D13.5 | Orange 12 | | E13?.1 | Yellow 1 |
| D16.4 | Red 13 | | E22.12 | Black 5 |
| D16.5 | Brown 14 | | B13.6 | coax → U1.15 |
| D17.10 | Brown 4 | | (wires 3 red, 11 yellow cut) | |
| D17.12 | White 6 | | | |

(OCR-cleaned; verify against the scan before relying on D13/E13/B11
identities.) These are taps into the **video timing chain** (counters,
sync, dot clock) — B13 is implicated in dot-clock generation (the B13
bulletin warns Fairchild/SG-made parts break 80-column mode).

## Do we need those fly leads? Mostly no — with one caveat

The O1's screen is **memory-mapped video RAM**; the char-gen socket tap
(UA15) gives the font. So the video personality can be built as pure
**memory-side reconstruction**: watch video-RAM writes on the Z80 bus
(already have them), read the installed font ROM via the UA15 tap,
render the frame in the RP2350 → HDMI/VGA. No fly leads, no soldered
taps. ScreenPac mode-register writes are also bus-visible, so 80/104
column switching is tracked automatically.

**Caveat / research task:** the fly leads exist because the real
ScreenPac *re-times the video circuitry itself* (it drives the original
CRT at 80/104-column dot clocks). We only need to care if (a) we ever
want to drive the original CRT through the ScreenPac path, or (b) a
ScreenPac is *physically installed* alongside us — as on the fully
loaded host machine — in which case our personality must **snoop, not
drive** (defer to the installed board). Action: identify each tapped
IC's function against `research/osborne1/OCC1_1A2011-00_Schem_RevE.pdf`
(B11/B13/B16/D13/D16–D18/E22) so the "what the ScreenPac changes
electrically" story is documented even though we don't replicate it.

## Open questions

- Char-gen socket pinout confirmation (ScreenPac install pages +
  Rev E schematic; research-gaps #3).
- HDMI vs VGA as the primary output (decided with front-panel hardware).

## Deliverables

- ScreenPac register emulation + renderer
- Font-ROM init reader
- Validation vs. `research/screenpac/2F00040_service_2ndEd_1983.pdf`
