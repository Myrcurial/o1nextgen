# Osborne 1 ROM variants — canonical inventory

**Issue:** #70. **Status:** first pass — the stock and third-party images we
hold are identified by CRC32 and cross-referenced against MAME; the open
questions at the end are the work that remains.

The machine has two ROM sockets in play:

| Socket | Package | Size | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| UD11 | 2732 (24-pin) | 4 KiB | Monitor / BIOS — the Z80 code that boots the machine |
| UA15 | 2716 (24-pin) | 2 KiB | Character generator (the 6×9 font the video logic reads) |

Both were replaced or re-programmed by the third-party upgrade vendors, so
"the Osborne 1 ROM" is really a family. This document is the map.

## Method

Every image is identified by **CRC32 over the raw bytes** plus size. CRC32 is
what MAME's ROM definitions and the archive indices both publish, so it is the
only key that cross-references cleanly. Two independent sources agreeing on a
CRC is treated as positive identification; a CRC agreeing under two different
*names* is treated as a finding, not an error.

## Stock monitor ROM (UD11, 4 KiB)

| Rev | Our copy | CRC32 | MAME name | MAME BIOS slot |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A (1981) | — | — | `osba.bin` | `vera` — **NO_DUMP** |
| 1.2 | — | — | `osb12.bin` | `ver12` — **NO_DUMP** |
| 1.2.1 | — | — | `osb121.bin` | `ver121` — **NO_DUMP** |
| 1.3 | — | — | `osb13.bin` | `ver13` — **NO_DUMP** (source disk held: `research/source-code/OSROM13.IMD`) |
| 1.4 | `tools/emulator-setup/roms/rev1.40.ud11` | `3d966335` | `rev1.40.ud11` | `ver14` |
| 1.43 | `research/roms/os1-143.rom` | `91a48e3c` | `rev1.43.ud11` | `ver143` |
| 1.44 | `research/roms/os1-144.rom` | `c0596b14` | `3a10082-00rev-e.ud11` | `ver144` |

Corroboration: BrettHallen's `ROM/OCC1_v140.BIN`, `OCC1_v143.BIN` and
`OCC1_v144.BIN` are byte-identical to the three we hold (same CRCs), and
`research/source-code/BIOS-144-source/rom144.asm` is the original ACT80 source
for 1.44 (#72).

Two things worth noting:

- **MAME's "ver144" is the part `3a10082-00` Rev E**, not a file named
  "1.44". The revision and the part number are two names for one image.
- **BIOS A, 1.2, 1.2.1 and 1.3 have never been dumped** (MAME carries them as
  `NO_DUMP` placeholders). We hold the **ROM 1.3 source disk**, so 1.3 is
  potentially reconstructible — see "Open questions".

## Character generator (UA15, 2 KiB)

There are **two distinct images** in circulation, and which one a machine has
tracks the BIOS revision:

| Image | CRC32 | Paired with | Our copies |
|---|---|---|---|
| Early | `5297c109` | BIOS A … 1.4 | `tools/emulator-setup/roms/char.ua15` |
| Late | `6c1eab0d` | BIOS 1.43, 1.44, and every ScreenPac / Nuevo machine | `research/roms/os1-vid8.rom`, `research/roms/os1vid80.rom`, `research/roms/OCC1_ScreenPac_RevA.BIN` |

MAME's driver carries the early image five times, once per BIOS slot 0–4, with
the comment *"this is CHRROM from v1.4 BIOS MB"*, and the late image for slots
5 and 6 (1.43 / 1.44). That is the evidence for the pairing, and it is the
"early font / late font" distinction that #44 asks about — **both variants are
now captured in this repo.**

### Finding: one late image, five names

The bytes `6c1eab0d` appear under five different names across three sources:

| Source | Name |
|---|---|
| Maslin's archive | `os1-vid8.rom` |
| Maslin's archive | `os1vid80.rom` |
| BrettHallen | `OCC1_char.BIN` |
| BrettHallen | `OCC1_ScreenPac_RevA.BIN` ("Screen Pac BIOS Rev. A") |
| MAME | `7a3007-00.ud15` and `character_generator_6-29-84.14` |

So the stock late character generator, the ScreenPac's 2 KiB ROM and the
Nuevo-era date-stamped character generator are **the same 2 KiB image**. The
ScreenPac's 80/104-column capability therefore does not live in this ROM, and
MAME models the ScreenPac as a *clone of `osborne1` with no ROM differences at
all* (`osborne1sp` is a `COMP` of `osborne1`, while `osborne1nv` is a separate
machine with its own ROMs). That matches the picture that the Nuevo 80-column
implementation is a different design from the OCC one.

## Third-party ROMs

| ROM | Size | CRC32 | Our copy | What it is |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Micro Management **OZROM 1E** | 4 KiB | `ba1f6131` | `research/roms/OZROM-1E/OZROM_1E.BIN` | Third-party replacement monitor ROM, © 1984 Micro Management. Strings: `OZROM 1E #00187`, `(c) 1984 Micro Management`, `Slip disk in drive and press RETURN.` Manual in the same folder. |
| Nuevo Electronics **Rev 1.51** | 4 KiB | `298da402` | `research/nuevo/NUEVO151.BIN` | Nuevo's replacement monitor ROM. Strings: `OSBORNE 1 COMPUTER`, `ROM Rev 1.51`, `COPYRIGHT 1983, OSBORNE COMPUTER CORP.`, `COPYRIGHT 1984, NUEVO ELECTRONICS CORP.` — i.e. an OCC ROM with Nuevo's DD/video patches. MAME name: `monrom-rev1.51-12.ud11`. |
| **SWP co-processor** | 4 KiB | `948556db` | `research/roms/swp-p88.rom` | The SWP co-processor board's own ROM. **This is 8088 code, not Z80** (`8C C8 8E D8` = `MOV AX,CS` / `MOV DS,AX`), and it carries the WD179x disk-BIOS error table (`Clock Error`, `Late DMA`, `ID CRC Error`, … `Type C to CANCEL`, `R to RETRY`, `I to IGNORE error`). Maslin's index describes it as "SWP Plus-88 card for Kaypro 2/4/10". The board and interposer card are common to every host machine and only the driver varies, so this is the 8088-side firmware of the CoPower-88 family — #3/#4/#5. |
| OCC 1.44 + OZROM combined | 8 KiB | `edc31846` | *not copied* | BrettHallen's 2764 image for the 2732→2764 daughterboard, holding OCC 1.44 and OZROM 1E with A12 selecting between them. Recorded here for completeness. |

## MAME cross-reference

MAME carries three Osborne 1 machines; the relationship between them is itself
evidence about the upgrade boards:

| MAME machine | Year | Parent | ROM set |
|---|---|---|---|
| `osborne1` | 1981 | — | BIOS A/1.2/1.2.1/1.3 (NO_DUMP) + 1.4 + 1.43 + 1.44, chargen early + late |
| `osborne1sp` "Osborne-1 with SCREEN-PAC" | 1983 | `osborne1` | **no ROM differences** — a clone, so the ScreenPac is modelled as hardware only |
| `osborne1nv` "Osborne-1 (Nuevo Video)" | 1984 | `osborne1` | `monrom-rev1.51-12.ud11` + `7a3007-00.ud15` + `character_generator_6-29-84.14` — its own BIOS and chargen |

`tools/check_o1_map.sh` already selects a driver from the boot image's
`52-`/`80-`/`104-` prefix (`osborne1` / `osborne1nv` / `osborne1sp`), so this
table is also the map from video mode to ROM set.

## Open questions

1. **Do the two character generators actually differ in the font?** MAME pairs
   `5297c109` with BIOS ≤ 1.4 and `6c1eab0d` with 1.43+, which is strong
   evidence of a font revision, but nobody has rendered the two side by side.
   Cheap to settle: dump both to a bitmap grid and compare glyphs.
2. **What is BrettHallen's "Screen Pac BIOS Rev. A"?** It is byte-identical to
   the stock late character generator, so the label may be wrong — or the
   ScreenPac genuinely ships an unmodified char-gen and does its 80-column work
   entirely in hardware. Settle against the ScreenPac install and service pages
   (`research/screenpac/`, `research/osborne1/`). Affects #24.
3. **ROM 1.3 can probably be reconstructed.** We hold the 1.3 source disk
   (`research/source-code/OSROM13.IMD`, comment `rom 1.3, cbios .3 osborne
   source 12/16/81`) while MAME carries 1.3 as `NO_DUMP`. Reassembling it from
   the ACT80 sources would fill a real gap upstream, and would also give us
   BIOS A / 1.2 / 1.2.1 if those sources exist on the other source disks.
   Part of #72.
4. **Confirm `swp-p88.rom` is host-independent.** The working assumption is
   that the co-processor board and interposer are common and only the host
   driver differs, which makes this the CoPower-88 ROM rather than a
   Kaypro-only artefact. A disassembly would confirm it and simultaneously
   yield the host mailbox protocol — #3/#4/#5.

- Cross-reference data — MAME `src/mame/osborne/osborne1.cpp` (`ROM_START( osborne1 )`, `ROM_START( osborne1nv )`, and the `COMP()` lines).
