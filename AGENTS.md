# AGENTS.md — working agreement for AI agents in this repo

This file is the authoritative operating procedure for any AI coding/research
agent working in `o1nextgen`. Follow it over generic defaults.

## Issue tracking: GitHub ONLY

- All issues, planning, phases, and task state for this project live in
  **GitHub Issues** on `Myrcurial/o1nextgen`. Use `gh issue list`,
  `gh issue view #N`, `gh issue create`.
- **Do NOT use the Linear MCP server for this project.** A Linear connection
  exists on this machine for unrelated work in other repos. Nothing in Linear
  refers to o1nextgen. Never create, search, update, or reference Linear
  issues here — if the Linear MCP responds with issues about other products,
  that is expected; ignore it entirely.
- Same for PRs: GitHub only, via `gh pr ...`.

## Git workflow

1. **Branch from `main`** for every unit of work. Branch names are
   `<area>/<slug>`, where area matches the work type:
   `feature/`, `research/`, `docs/`, `tools/`.
   (e.g. `research/o1-memory-io-map`, `docs/research-archive-readme-video`)
2. **Commit frequently** — small, self-contained commits that each compile
   into a coherent state. Don't hold a day's work uncommitted.
3. **Every commit must be GPG-signed.** The repo config already sets
   `commit.gpgsign=true` (key `D61B664A126EE2410F5A0BF1D3FB4FF4931F5225`).
   - If signing fails (key locked, agent can't reach pinentry, etc.),
     **stop and tell the user** — never bypass with `--no-gpg-sign` or by
     flipping the config.
   - Verify with `git log --format='%h %G? %s'` — every commit shows `G`.
4. **Commit message format:** `<area>: <imperative summary> (#issue)`
   - Areas in use: `docs:`, `research:`, `tools:` (plus merge commits).
   - Reference the driving issue in every commit: `(#9)`,
     `(#3 #4, part of #5)`.
   - `closes #N` only when the commit/PR fully completes the issue;
     `part of #N` for partial progress. Never claim `closes` prematurely —
     issue #40 sat open while its "closes #40" commit was stranded on an
     unmerged branch.
5. **Push the branch, then open a PR** (`gh pr create`) with a title
   mirroring the commit message and a body linking the issues.
6. **Merge through the GitHub PR**, not local merges pushed to `main`.
   Local merges leave PRs stuck in "closed" (not "merged") state and skip
   issue auto-close — PRs #36–#38 in this repo's history show that failure
   mode. Prefer `gh pr merge` or the web button; delete the local branch
   after merge.
7. Never commit directly to `main`; never force-push `main`.

## Repo layout and house rules

- `research/` is an **intentional in-repo archive** of large binaries (PDF
  manuals, TD0/IMD disk images, photos). They are safety copies of
  documentation the project cannot complete without. **Never delete,
  "clean up", or gitignore them.** Provenance is recorded in
  `research/README.md` — when adding an archive file, add its row to the
  matching table there (file, description, source URL).
- `docs/` holds the analysis output: one Markdown doc per peripheral/area
  (`copower88-protocol.md`, `rt60a-analysis.md`, …), cross-referencing issue
  numbers and the `research/` files it derives from. Mermaid diagrams are
  welcome.
- `tools/` is the extraction pipeline (`cpmfs.py`, `edsk2raw.py`,
  `extract_all.sh`) — Python stdlib only, no new dependencies without asking.
- `research/pictures/` photos of the physical boards are **primary sources**,
  taken in-project — never treat them as replaceable stock images.
- Issue labels: `research`, `pre-hardware`, `hardware`, `firmware`,
  `software`, `hardware-gated`. Phase flow: Phase 0 research → Phase 1
  hardware (KiCad) → Phase 2 Pico 2 W firmware → Phase 3 Osborne-side
  software → Phase 4 on-hardware validation. Don't start `hardware-gated`
  work in software sessions.

## Before declaring done

- `git status` clean or deliberately dirty (say which); branch pushed.
- PR open and linked to its issues; no dangling `closes #N`.
- Docs cross-references resolve: if you cite `docs/foo.md` or
  `research/bar/`, that file must exist **on the branch you're merging**.
- Commits verified signed (`%G?` = `G`).
